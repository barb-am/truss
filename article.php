                <p>Among his books listed here, his most recent is probably the best introduction &mdash; it's a
                    succinct summary of what's been on his mind for many a year and what's on his mind now: how
                    mankind may hatch and survive the hatching.</p>
                <p>Of the other, larger, books. <u>Nine Chains to the Moon</u> is his earliest and most
                    openly metaphysical. <u>The Unfinished Epic of Industrialization</u> the most
                    beautiful. <u>Ideas and Integrities</u> his most personal. <u>No More Secondhand God</u> the
                    most generalized, <u>World Design Science Decade</u> (co-authored with John McHale) the most
                    programmatic.</p>

                <p>People who beef about Fuller mainly complain about his repetition &mdash; the same ideas again
                    and again, it's embarrassing. It is embarrassing, also illuminating, because the same notions
                    take
                    on different uses when re-approached from different angles or with different contexts.
                    Fuller's lectures have a raga quality of rich nonlinear endless improvisation full of convergent
                    surprises.</p>

                <p>Some are put off by his language, which makes demands on your head like suddenly discovering
                    an extra engine in your car &mdash; if you don't let it drive you faster, it'll drag you. Fuller
                    won't wait. He spent two years silent after illusion language got him in trouble, and he
                    returned to human
                    communication with a redesigned instrument.</p>

                <p>To comprehend this total scheme we note that long ago a man went through the woods, as you may
                    have
                    done,
                    and
                    I certainly have, trying to find the shortest way through the woods in a given direction. He
                    found
                    trees
                    fallen across his path. He climbed over those crisscrossed trees and suddenly found himself
                    poised
                    on a
                    tree
                    that was slowly teetering. It happened to be lying across another great tree, and the other end
                    of
                    the
                    tree
                    on which he found himself teetering lay under a third great fallen tree. As He teetered he saw
                    the
                    third
                    big
                    tree lifting. It seemed impossible to him. He went over and tried using his own muscles to lift
                    that
                    great
                    tree. He couldn't budge it. Then he climbed back atop the first smaller tree, purposefully
                    teetering
                    it,
                    and
                    surely enough it again elevated the larger tree. I'm certain that the first man who found such a
                    tree
                    thought that it was a magic tree, and may have dragged it home and erected it as man's first
                    totem.
                    It
                    was
                    probably a long time before he learned that any stout tree would do, and thus extracted the
                    concept
                    of
                    the
                    generalized principle of leverage out of all his earlier successive special-case experiences
                    with
                    such
                    accidental discoveries.</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>To begin our position-fixing aboard our Spaceship Earth we must first acknowledge that the
                    abundance
                    of
                    immediately consumable, obviously desirable or utterly essential resources have been sufficient
                    until
                    now to
                    allow us to carry on despite our ignorance. Being eventually exhaustible and spoilable, they
                    have
                    been
                    adequate only up to this critical moment. This cushion-for-error of humanity's survival and
                    growth
                    up to
                    now
                    was apparently provided just as a bird inside of the egg is provided with liquid nutriment to
                    develop it
                    to
                    a certain point. But then by design the nutriment is exhausted at just the time when the chick
                    is
                    large
                    enough to be able to locomote on its own legs. And so as the chick pecks at the shell seeking
                    more
                    nutriment
                    it inadvertently breaks open the shell. Stepping forth from its initial sanctuary, the young
                    bird
                    must
                    now
                    forage on its own legs and wings to discover the next phase of its regenerative sustenance.</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>A new, physically uncomprised, metaphysical initiative of unblased integrity could unify the
                    world.
                    It
                    could
                    and probably will be provided by the utterly impersonal problem solutions of the computers.</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>Heisenberg's principle of 'indeterminism' which recognized the experimental discovery that the
                    act of
                    measuring always alters that which was being measured turns experience into a continuous and
                    never-repeatable evolutionary scenario.</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>The gold supply is so negligible as to make it pure voodoo to attempt to valve the world's
                    economic
                    evolution
                    traffic through the gold-sized needle's 'eye.'</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>Brain deals exclusively with the physical, and mind exclusively with the metaphysical. Wealth is
                    the
                    progressive mastery of matter by mind....</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>
                <p>Possession is becoming progressively burdensome and wasteful and therefore obsolete.</p>
                <p>&mdash;</p>

                <p>You and I are inherently different and complementary. Together we average as zero &mdash; that
                    is, aseternity.</p>

                <p>Common to all such "human" mechanisms &mdash; and without which they are imbecile contraptions
                    &mdash; is
                    their guidance by a phantom captain. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This phantom captain has neither weight nor sensorial tangibility, as has often been
                    scientifically
                    proven by
                    careful weighing operations at the moment of abandonment of the ship by the phantom captain,
                    i.e.,
                    at
                    the
                    instant of "death." He may be likened to the variant of polarity dominance in our bipolar
                    electric
                    world
                    which, when balanced and unit, vanishes as abstract unity 1 or 0. With the phantom captain's
                    departure,
                    the
                    mechanism becomes inoperative and very.quickly disintegrates into basic chemical elements.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This captain has not only an infinite self-identity characteristic but, also, an infinite
                    understanding.
                    He
                    has furthermore, infinite sympathy with all captains of mechanisms similar to his. (...)</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>An illuminating rationalization indicated that captains &mdash; being phantom, abstract,
                    infinite,
                    and
                    bound
                    to other captains by a bond of 'understanding as proven by their recognition of each other's
                    signals
                    and
                    the
                    meaning thereof by reference to a common direction (toward &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;) &mdash; are
                    not
                    only
                    all
                    related, but are one and the same captain. Mathematically, since characteristics of unity exist,
                    they
                    cannot
                    be non-identical. </p>

                <p>Standing by the lake on a jump-or-think basis, the very first spontaneous question coming to mind
                    was,
                    &ldquo;if you put aside everything you've ever been asked to believe and have recourse only to
                    your
                    own
                    experiences do you have any conviction arising from those experiences which either discards or
                    must
                    assume
                    an a priori greater intellect than the intellect of man?&rdquo; The answer was swift and
                    positive.
                    Experience had clearly demonstrated an a priori anticipatory and only intellectually
                    apprehendable
                    orderliness of interactive principles operating in the universe into which we are born. These
                    principles
                    are
                    discovered but are never invented by man. I said to myself, &ldquo;I have faith in the integrity
                    of
                    the
                    anticipatory intellectual wisdom which we may call 'God.'&rdquo; &nbsp;My next question was, "Do
                    I
                    know
                    best
                    or does God know best whether I may be of any value to the integrity of universe?&rdquo; The
                    answer
                    was,
                    &ldquo;You don't know and no man knows, but the faith you have just established out of
                    experience
                    imposes
                    recognition of the a priori wisdom of the fact of your being.&rdquo; Apparently addressing
                    myself, I
                    said,
                    &ldquo;You do not have the right to eliminate yourself, you do not belong to you. You belong to
                    the
                    universe, The significance of you will forever remain obscure to you, but you may assume that
                    you
                    are
                    fulfilling your significance if you apply yourself to converting all your experience to highest
                    advantage of
                    others. You and all men are here for the sake of other men.&rdquo;</p>

                    of
                    civilization such as the Bronze Age or Stone Age. If we only understood how that cumulative
                    industrial
                    wealth has come about, we could stop playing obsolete games, but that is a task that cannot be
                    accomplished
                    by political and social reforms. Man is so deeply conditioned in his reflexes by his millenniums

                <p>Tension and Compression are complementary functions of structure. Therefore as functions they
                    only
                    co-exist.
                    When pulling a tensional rope its girth contracts in compression. When we load a column in
                    compression
                    its
                    girth tends to expand in tension. When we investi- . gate tension and compression, we find that
                    compression
                    members, as you all know as architects, have very limited lengths in relation to their cross
                    sections.
                    They
                    get too long and too slender and will readily break. Tension members, when you pull them, tend
                    to
                    pull,
                    approximately, (almost but never entirely), straight instead of trying to curve more and more as
                    do
                    too
                    thin
                    compressively loaded columns. The contraction of the tension members in their girth, when
                    tensionally
                    loaded, brings its atoms closer together which makes it even stronger. There is no limit ratio
                    of
                    cross
                    section to length in tensional members of structural systems. There is a fundamental limit ratio
                    in
                    compression. Therefore when nature has very large tasks to do, such as cohering the solar system
                    or
                    the
                    universe she arranges her structural systems both in the microcosm and macrocosm in the
                    following
                    manner.
                    Nature has compression operating in little remotely positioned islands, as high energy
                    concentrations,
                    such
                    as the earth and other planets, in the macrocosm; or as islanded electrons, or protons or other
                    atomic
                    nuclear components in the microcosm while cohering the whole universal system, both macro and
                    micro,
                    of
                    mutually remote, compressional, and oft non-simultaneous, islands by comprehensive tension;
                    &mdash;
                    compression islands in a non-simultaneous universe of tension. The Universe is a tensegrity.</p>

                <p>I was born cross-eyed. Not until I was four years old was it discovered that this was caused by
                    my
                    being
                    abnormally farsighted. My vision was thereafter fully corrected with lenses. Until four I could
                    see
                    only
                    large patterns, houses, trees, outlines of people with blurred coloring. While I saw two dark
                    areas
                    on human faces, I did not see a human eye or a teardrop or a human hair until I was four. Despite my
                    new
                    ability to apprehend details, my childhood's spontaneous dependence only upon big pattern clues has
                    persisted</p>
                <p>I am convinced that neither I nor any other human, past or present, was or is a genius. I am
                    convinced that what I have every physically normal child also has at birth. We could, of course,
                    hypothesize
                    that</p>
                <p>all babies are born geniuses and get swiftly de-geniused. Unfavorable circumstances,
                    shortsightedness, frayed nervous systems, and ignorantly articulated love and fear of eiders tend to
                    shut off many of the
                    child's brain capability valves. I was lucky in avoiding too many disconnects. <span

                <p>In the 1920's with but little open country highway mileage in operation, automobile accidents
                    were
                    concentrated and frequently occurred within our urban and suburban presence. Witnessing a number
                    of
                    accidents, I observed that warning signs later grew up along the roads leading to danger points
                    and
                    that
                    more traffic and motorcycle police were put on duty. The authorities tried to cure the malady by
                    reforming
                    the motorists. A relatively few special individual drivers with much experience, steady
                    temperament,
                    good
                    coordination and nat- ural tendency to anticipate and understand the psychology of others
                    emerged as
                    "good"
                    and approximately accident-free drivers. Many others were accident prone.</p>
                <p>In lieu of the after-the-fact curative reform, trending to highly specialized individual offender
                    case
                    histories, my philosophy urged the anticipatory avoidance of the accident potentials through
                    invention
                    of
                    generalized highway dividers, grade separators, clover leafing and adequately banked curves and
                    automatic
                    traffic control stop-lighting systems. I saw no reason why the problem shouldn't be solved by
                    preventative
                    design rather than attempted reforms. My resolve: Reshape environment; don't try to reshape
                    man,</p>

                <p>Concept Twelve - SELF DISCIPLINES</p>
                <p>Working assumptions, cautions, encouragements, and restraints of intuitive formulations and
                    spontaneous
                    actions. My own rule: "Do not mind if I am not understood as long as I am not
                    misunderstood."</p>
                <p>Personal Self Disciplining. In 1927 I gave up forever the general economic dictum of society,
                    i.e.
                    that
                    every
                    individual who wants to survive must earn a living . I substituted, therefore, the finding made
                    in
                    concept
                    one, i.e. the individual's antiestrogenic responsibility in universe. I sought for the tasks
                    that
                    needed
                    to
                    be done that no one else was doing or attempting to do, which if done would physically and
                    economically
                    advantage society and eliminate pain.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, it was necessary for me to discipline my faculties to develop technical and
                    scientific
                    capability to-invent the physical innovations and their service industry logistics.</p>
